I am currently a Ph.D. Candidate in Public Health at University of California, Irvine.

My research interests mainly lie in the intersection of global health and infectious disease epidemiology. I am curious about 'atypical communities' that fall outside of traditional public health and public policy spheres, such as newly emerging communities. My PhD dissertation work centered around investigating potential socio-behavioral and biological factors influencing malaria infections among migrants to a newly established gold mining village in Western Ethiopia. 

I am a big fan of storytelling in all of its many ways, and thoroughly enjoy reading, writing and the theatre! I have aspirations to one day put on a stage production about the life of Benjamin Jesty, a farmer from the 1700s who lived in a small village in England (near to where I grew up) and who started smallpox innoculations.
