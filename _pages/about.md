I am currently a Ph.D. Candidate in Public Health at University of California, Irvine.

My research interests mainly lie in the intersection of global health and infectious disease epidemiology. I am curious about 'atypical communities' that fall outside of traditional public health and public policy spheres, such as newly emerging communities. My current dissertation work centers around investigating potential socio-behavioral and biological factors influencing malaria infections among migrants to a newly established gold mining village in Western Ethiopia. 

I am a big fan of storytelling in all of its many ways, and thoroughly enjoy reading, writing and the theatre! 

In my spare time, I enjoy reading and the theatre!
