**Teaching Philosophy**

I have a strong interest in higher education pedagogy. During my PhD at UC Irvine, I worked closely with UC Irvine's **Division of Teaching Excellence and Innovation**, where I was a _Pedagogical Scholar_ and an _Education Development Scholar_. Through these roles, I developed and facilitated the School of Medicine's Teaching Assistant Professional Development Program (TA training), as well as the Summer Teaching Apprenticeship Program (STAP) - a leadership program for graduate students teaching as the Instructor of Record for the first time.
