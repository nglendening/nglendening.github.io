* **A conceptual framework for understanding extractive settlements and disease: demography, environment, and epidemiology**

   * Health services are normally focused on communities that already exist. Communities that fall outside of this situation (short-term migrant communities, refugee camps, new settlements) often fall outside of the normal healthcare system. Here we describe a framework for conceptualising and understanding the environmental, demographic, and epidemiologic dynamics of settlements based on extractive endeavours. We argue that this type of settlement is sufficiently common that it warrants attention, and that a planetary health perspective is optimal for addressing the needs of such settlement communities. We then provide a case study from a gold mining settlement in a malarious region of Western Ethiopia. We close with some suggestions for provision of health services for such settlements. Namely, any aggregation of humans should have access to basic healthcare services; special consideration should be made to ensure that health services are steadily available to the community; employing members of the community for healthcare services may be optimal; and the health considerations should include environmental considerations beyond what is normally included in public health practices (i.e. vector control, basic hygiene)..
* **A cross-sectional study investigating malaria prevalence and associated predictors of infection among migrants to a newly established gold mining settlement in the Gambella Region of Ethiopia**

Malaria is a major disease burden in Ethiopia. Migration can influence malaria transmission dynamics, with individuals relocating from malaria-free highland regions to malarious lowlands potentially facing elevated risks of contracting malaria. Migrants may find it difficult to protect themselves against malaria and have limited access to diagnosis or treatment. Settlers in gold mining sites are one type of migrant and are often neglected in malaria research yet may have particularly high malaria risk. This study was a malaria prevalence survey among settlers in a new gold mining settlement in the highly malarious Gambella Region, Ethiopia.

Methods
n = 590 people were surveyed for demographic information and their knowledge and practices of malaria. Participants were tested for malaria using rapid diagnostic tests and microscopy. Using logistic regressions, the influence of demographic characteristics on malaria infections and bed net access were analysed. A sub-sample of participants was interviewed to comprehend settlement living conditions and healthcare accessibility.

Results
The overall prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum was 37.5% (CI 32.4–42.3%). Young children were most likely to have malaria, with individuals aged 15–24 having 67% lower odds (aOR: 0.33; CI 0.13–0.86) of infection compared to those aged 1–4 years old. Meanwhile, those age 25-plus had 75% decreased odds of malaria infection (aOR 0.25; CI 0.10–0.65). Individuals with bed nets had ~ 50% decreased odds of testing positive for falciparum malaria than those reporting having no bed net (aOR: 0.47; CI 0.22–0.97). Individuals who relocated from low elevation with high malaria test positivity rate areas were more prone to testing positive for malaria, as were those residing in densely populated households with multiple malaria cases. Conversely, individuals from higher elevations with low malaria test positivity rates, and those living in households with 5–10 occupants and < 2 malaria infections, were more likely to possess bed nets.

Conclusions
This gold mining settlement provides an example of an oft-neglected atypical community where malaria is a significant, but under-addressed, health problem. Within this community, future interventions focused on distributing bed nets, particularly to larger households and those with children, have great potential to alleviate the malaria burden. Efforts should also be made to provide affordable, and accessible, early diagnosis and treatment. </font>
